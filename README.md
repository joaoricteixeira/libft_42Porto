# Libft

Libft is a custom C library that reimplements a set of standard C library functions, along with additional utilities for memory management, string manipulation, linked lists, and more.  
This project serves as a foundational library for future 42 school projects.

## ðŸ§© Overview

The goal of this project is to code a C library that contains a collection of general-purpose functions â€” some of which are part of the standard C library, and others that are useful additions.

Libft is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1:** Reimplementation of standard libc functions (e.g., `memset`, `strdup`, `atoi`, etc.).
2. **Part 2:** Creation of additional useful functions and data structures (e.g., linked list utilities).
